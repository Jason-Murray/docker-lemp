# docker-lemp
A simple docker lemp stack which attempts to provide a poor imitation of folder "parking" like Laravel Valet.

Some assumptions are made re folder structure, but these could be changed in the docker-compose.yml file.

```
├── lemp
│   └── <clone this project here>
└── lemp-sites
    ├── example1.test
    │   └── public OR web
    └── example2.test
        └── public OR web
```
